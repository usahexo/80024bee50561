<p>Sports books took in a record $10 million in bets on the first day of the NCAA tournament, according to the Nevada Gaming Control Board.</p>
<p>That shattered the old mark of $7.8 million set last year.</p>
<p>The action was so heavy Friday that several books had to turn away customers because they ran out of money.</p>
<p>“It was wall-to-wall people,” said Jay Kornegay, vice president of the sports book at the Venetian. “We had people backed up out the door.”</p>
<p>Kornegay said his book took in about $2 million in bets, including $700,000 on the Kansas-Pennsylvania State game alone. He said that was more than double what they took on that matchup last year.</p>
<p>Nevada sports books have taken in nearly $43 million on this year’s tournament, up from $36 million at the same point last year.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-sports-betting-app-revenue-up-12-in-2017"><a href="#Nevada-sports-betting-app-revenue-up-12-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sports betting app revenue up 12% in 2017"></a>Nevada sports betting app revenue up 12% in 2017</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Control Board released its annual report on sports betting on Wednesday, revealing that the state’s regulated sportsbooks recorded a 12 percent increase in revenue last year, with a total of $248.8 million wagered.</p>
<p>Of that amount, $192.7 million was bet on football, basketball, and baseball games alone.</p>
<p>According to the report, sports betting generated $19.7 million in tax revenue for the state in 2017, up from the $16.9 million it generated in 2016.</p>
<p>Nevada has been regulating sports betting since 1949, and is currently the only state in the US where it is legal to do so.</p>
<p>In recent years, several other states have legalized sports betting as well, including New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. However, those states all allow bets to be placed through bookmakers licensed by their respective state gaming commissions, whereas Nevada remains the only state where people can place bets at live sportsbooks.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada’s-largest-sportsbook-takes-in-over-5-million-in-bets-in-first-week-of-NFL-season"><a href="#Nevada’s-largest-sportsbook-takes-in-over-5-million-in-bets-in-first-week-of-NFL-season" class="headerlink" title="Nevada’s largest sportsbook takes in over $5 million in bets in first week of NFL season"></a>Nevada’s largest sportsbook takes in over $5 million in bets in first week of NFL season</h1><p>The William Hill sportsbook in Nevada took in more than $5 million worth of bets in the first week of the NFL season, according to local reports.</p>
<p>The sportsbook, which is located at the Red Rock Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, saw a surge in business thanks to the NFL’s opening weekend.</p>
<p>“The first week is always good, but this year it was really good because of all of the (point) spreads and the over/unders that were up,” said Jeff Stoneback, director of race and sports for William Hill USA.</p>
<p>In total, William Hill took in $5.7 million worth of bets across all its Nevada sportsbooks during the first week of the NFL season.</p>
<p>The busy week for sportsbooks comes as no surprise; the NFL is one of the most popular sports leagues in America, with millions of fans tuning in each week to watch their favorite teams battle it out on the gridiron.</p>
<p>This year’s NFL season kicked off on September 6th with a matchup between reigning Super Bowl champions the Philadelphia Eagles and the Atlanta Falcons. The game was unsurprisingly one of the most bet on matchups of Week 1, with over $2 million wagered on it at Nevada sportsbooks.</p>

This is because they offer a number of advantages over traditional methods, such as better odds and faster payouts.</p>
<p>When it comes to betting on sports, there is no question that mobile apps are the way to go. Not only do they offer better odds than traditional methods, but they also payout faster. This means that you can get your hands on your winnings sooner, which is a big plus for sharp bettors.</p>
<p>In addition to better odds and faster payouts, mobile apps also offer a number of other benefits. For example, many of them allow you to place bets in real time, which gives you a competitive edge over other bettors. They also make it easy to keep track of your betting history, which can help you improve your betting strategies.</p>
<p>Overall, mobile apps are a great choice for sharp bettors. They offer a number of advantages over traditional methods, including better odds and faster payouts. In addition, they are easy to use and provide a number of other benefits. So if you are looking for an edge in the world of sports betting, be sure to check out mobile apps.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-sports-betting-app-revenues-expected-to-exceed-1-5-billion-in-2018"><a href="#Nevada-sports-betting-app-revenues-expected-to-exceed-1-5-billion-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Nevada sports betting app revenues expected to exceed $1.5 billion in 2018"></a>Nevada sports betting app revenues expected to exceed $1.5 billion in 2018</h1><p>A new study shows Nevada sports betting app revenues will exceed $1.5 billion in 2018, a sharp increase from the $1.1 billion generated in 2017.</p>
<p>The findings come from Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, which projects that mobile wagering will make up more than 60 percent of the total sports betting market in Nevada this year.</p>
<p>“With regulated mobile sports betting now available in eight states, and likely coming to more in the near future, we believe Nevada’s share of total U.S. gambling proceeds from mobile sports betting will decline from its current level of roughly two-thirds to just over one-half by the end of 2020,” reads the report.</p>
<p>That could have major implications for the Silver State’s bottom line. According to the study,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> sports betting app revenue accounted for 44 percent of all gambling revenue in Nevada last year – a number that is expected to grow to 52 percent by 2020.</p>
<p>Industry analysts say much of that growth can be attributed to the increasing popularity of sports betting among millennials. A recent poll commissioned by Eilers &amp; Krejcik found that more than half of all millennials plan on placing a bet on this year’s Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“The 18-to-34 age group continues to be an important target market for gaming companies as they look to offset slowing growth rates elsewhere in their customer base, and we expect this age cohort will account for a majority of mobile sports bets going forward,” said Chris Grove, head of research at Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming.</p>
