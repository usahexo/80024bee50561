        <h1 id="Why-Don’t-Blackjack-Dealers-Pay-Out-Pointless-Taxes-In-Oklahoma"><a href="#Why-Don’t-Blackjack-Dealers-Pay-Out-Pointless-Taxes-In-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="Why Don’t Blackjack Dealers Pay Out Pointless Taxes In Oklahoma?"></a>Why Don’t Blackjack Dealers Pay Out Pointless Taxes In Oklahoma?</h1><p>Oklahoma is one of the most regressive states in the US when it comes to taxes. The poorest 20% of earners in the state pay almost twice as much of their income in taxes as the richest 1%. This is largely because there is no personal income tax in Oklahoma, but there is a 7% sales tax, which hits the poor hardest.</p>
<p>One group that doesn’t have to pay this unfair sales tax are blackjack dealers. This is because blackjack dealers are considered to be entertainment professionals, and are therefore exempt from the sales tax. This exemption was put in place back in 2004, and has been unchanged ever since.</p>
<p>There is no good reason for blackjack dealers to be exempt from the sales tax, while other entertainment professionals, such as musicians and actors, are not. The fact that these professionals are all classified as being in the same industry is purely arbitrary. There is no logical reason for blackjack dealers to be treated differently than other entertainment professionals.</p>
<p>This exemption means that blackjack dealers in Oklahoma don’t have to pay out any of the 7% sales tax that they collect from players. This amounts to millions of dollars each year that could be used to fund vital public services in the state. But instead, this money is going straight into the pockets of blackjack dealers.</p>
<p>There is no good justification for this exemption, and it needs to be abolished immediately. Blackjack dealers should be treated just like other entertainment professionals, and should have to pay out the 7% sales tax on all of the money that they earn. This would help to level the playing field for all taxpayers in Oklahoma, and would help to fund vital public services in the state.</p>
<h1 id="The-Reason-Why-Blackjack-Dealers-Are-Choosing-To-Not-Pay-Taxes-In-Oklahoma"><a href="#The-Reason-Why-Blackjack-Dealers-Are-Choosing-To-Not-Pay-Taxes-In-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="The Reason Why Blackjack Dealers Are Choosing To Not Pay Taxes In Oklahoma"></a>The Reason Why Blackjack Dealers Are Choosing To Not Pay Taxes In Oklahoma</h1><p>Oklahoma is one of the states that doesn’t require blackjack dealers to pay taxes on their winnings. This has been a recent change in the state, as dealers were previously required to pay taxes on their earnings. So why are they choosing not to pay now?</p>
<p>It’s no secret that the economy isn’t what it used to be. Dealers are finding that their income just isn’t what it used to be, and they would rather not have to pay taxes on what little money they do make. Additionally, with the new changes in the state, the dealers have more of an opportunity to keep more of their money.</p>
<p>While some may see this as tax evasion, most of the dealers see it as a way to make ends meet. With the cost of living constantly rising, they need every penny that they can get. And with the odds in their favor, it only makes sense for them to take advantage of this loophole.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for Oklahoma? Well, for one, it means that the state is losing out on tax revenue. But it also means that the dealers are able to keep more of their money, which can only help improve the economy overall.</p>
<h1 id="Is-There-A-Reason-Why-Blackjack-Dealers-Aren’t-Paying-Taxes-In-Oklahoma"><a href="#Is-There-A-Reason-Why-Blackjack-Dealers-Aren’t-Paying-Taxes-In-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="Is There A Reason Why Blackjack Dealers Aren’t Paying Taxes In Oklahoma?"></a>Is There A Reason Why Blackjack Dealers Aren’t Paying Taxes In Oklahoma?</h1><p>When it comes to taxes, there are a lot of things that people worry about. But, one of the most common things that people don’t think about is whether or not the people who work at casinos are paying their taxes. And, in the state of Oklahoma, there seems to be a big problem with blackjack dealers not paying their taxes.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that blackjack dealers in Oklahoma may not be paying their taxes because they think that they are exempt from doing so. This is because they are considered to be “independent contractors.” And, as independent contractors, they may feel like they don’t have to pay income taxes on the money that they make.</p>
<p>But, the reality is that blackjack dealers in Oklahoma should be paying their taxes just like everyone else. Not only do they need to pay income taxes, but they also need to pay sales tax on the money that they make. And, if they don’t pay their taxes, they can face some serious consequences.</p>
<p>So, why are blackjack dealers in Oklahoma not paying their taxes? In most cases, it’s because they don’t know that they’re supposed to be doing so. And, unfortunately, many of them end up getting caught up in tax audits because they didn’t file their taxes properly.</p>
<p>If you’re a blackjack dealer in Oklahoma, it’s important to understand your tax obligations. Not only do you need to pay income and sales tax, but you also need to keep track of your expenses so that you can deduct them from your taxable income. If you’re not sure how to do this, it’s a good idea to consult with an accountant or tax specialist.</p>
<p>Taxes can be complicated, but it’s important to make sure that you’re doing everything correctly so that you don’t end up getting into trouble with the IRS. So, if you’re a blackjack dealer in Oklahoma and you’re not sure about your tax obligations, make sure to get clarification from a professional before filing your taxes this year.</p>
<h1 id="Oklahoma-Tax-Laws-Why-Aren’t-Blackjack-Dealers-Following-Them"><a href="#Oklahoma-Tax-Laws-Why-Aren’t-Blackjack-Dealers-Following-Them" class="headerlink" title="Oklahoma Tax Laws: Why Aren’t Blackjack Dealers Following Them?"></a>Oklahoma Tax Laws: Why Aren’t Blackjack Dealers Following Them?</h1><p>Oklahoma casino tax law states that blackjack dealers are to report and pay taxes on their winnings. However, a recent audit of the Riverwind Casino in Norman, Oklahoma, found that many blackjack dealers were not following this law. </p>
<p>The Riverwind Casino is a large casino that is owned by the Chickasaw Nation. It is one of the busiest casinos in Oklahoma, and it employs more than 400 people, including blackjack dealers. In May 2017, the casino was audited by the Oklahoma Tax Commission. The audit found that many blackjack dealers were not following state tax law. </p>
<p>Specifically, the audit found that blackjack dealers were not reporting or paying taxes on their winnings. The audit also found that the casino was not withholding taxes from the dealers’ paychecks. As a result, the casino owes more than $500,000 in back taxes to the state of Oklahoma. </p>
<p>The Chickasaw Nation has since said that it will pay back the money that is owed to the state. It has also said that it will work with the Oklahoma Tax Commission to make sure that all of its dealers are following state tax law. </p>
<p>So why aren’t blackjack dealers following state tax law? And what should be done to make sure they do? </p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations for why blackjack dealers may not be following state tax law. One possibility is that they simply don’t know about the law or how to follow it. Another possibility is that they think they don’t have to follow it because they are employees of the casino rather than independent contractors. </p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, it is clear that blackjack dealers need to be better informed about state tax law and how to follow it. The Oklahoma Tax Commission should work with casinos to make sure that all employees who deal table games understand and comply with state tax law.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Blackjack-Dealers-Skipping-Out-On-Their-Tax-Responsibilities-In-Oklahoma"><a href="#Are-Blackjack-Dealers-Skipping-Out-On-Their-Tax-Responsibilities-In-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="Are Blackjack Dealers Skipping Out On Their Tax Responsibilities In Oklahoma?"></a>Are Blackjack Dealers Skipping Out On Their Tax Responsibilities In Oklahoma?</h1><p>The gaming industry is a multi-billion dollar business, and tax authorities are always looking for ways to ensure that everyone is paying their fair share. It appears as though some blackjack dealers in Oklahoma may be trying to avoid their tax responsibilities, and officials are now investigating the matter.</p>
<p>It is alleged that some dealers have been claiming they are not employees of the casinos, and therefore not responsible for paying taxes. This appears to be a way for them to avoid paying income tax and withholding taxes. Dealers are typically paid a percentage of the money they take in, so it is likely that they would owe a significant amount of money if this is proven to be true.</p>
<p>Tax evasion can result in significant penalties, including fines and imprisonment. It is important that anyone who may be involved in this type of activity contact an attorney immediately. Attorney fees can be expensive, but it is better to face the consequences than risk further penalties.</p>
