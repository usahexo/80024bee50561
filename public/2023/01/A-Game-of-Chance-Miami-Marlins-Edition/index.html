Many experts picked them to finish near the bottom of the league once again. However, things started to look up for the Marlins when they made a few key acquisitions in the offseason.</p>
<p>One of those acquisitions was outfielder Ichiro Suzuki. Ichiro was a 10-time all-star and had a career .311 batting average. He was also a veteran presence who could provide guidance to the team’s younger players.</p>
<p>The Marlins also signed starting pitcher Edinson Volquez. Volquez had enjoyed success in previous seasons, and he was expected to be one of the team’s top starters.</p>
<p>With their new players in place, the Marlins entered the 2017 season with high hopes. Unfortunately, they got off to a slow start and found themselves in last place by the All-Star break.</p>
<p>However, they turned things around in the second half of the season and finished with a record of 79-83. While this wasn’t good enough to make the playoffs, it was an improvement over their previous season and gave fans hope for the future.</p>
<p>One of the bright spots for the Marlins during the 2017 season was Giancarlo Stanton. Stanton led the league in home runs with 59 and also finished in first place in RBIs with 132. He was voted as an all-star for the sixth time and won both the NL MVP award and Home Run Derby title.</p>
<p>Ichiro Suzuki also played well for Miami in his final season before retiring. He hit .274 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 112 games.</p>
<p>Overall, it was a disappointing season for Miami but there were some signs of progress. The team will look to build on that progress in 2018 and hopefully make it back to the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="The-Fish-are-On-the-Pond-a-Look-at-the-Miami-Marlins’-Casino-Life"><a href="#The-Fish-are-On-the-Pond-a-Look-at-the-Miami-Marlins’-Casino-Life" class="headerlink" title="The Fish are On the Pond: a Look at the Miami Marlins’ Casino Life"></a>The Fish are On the Pond: a Look at the Miami Marlins’ Casino Life</h1><p>The Fish are off to a strong start in the early days of the Miami Marlins’ casino life. The new ownership, led by Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter, has been shaking things up since they bought the team in October of 2017. Some fans are unsure about all of the changes, but most seem to agree that it’s time for a change.</p>
<p>One of the first decisions made by the new owners was to move the team from Miami to Little Havana. This was a controversial decision, but it’s one that seems to be paying off. The team is drawing big crowds to their games, and they’re playing some of their best baseball in years.</p>
<p>Another change made by the new owners was to sign Cuban slugger Jose Abreu. This was seen as a risky move by many, but it has already paid off dividends. Abreu is one of the most popular players on the team, and he’s already become a fan favorite in Miami.</p>
<p>One thing that hasn’t changed under the new ownership is the team’s commitment to giving back to the community. The Marlins are heavily involved in charity work, and they’re always looking for ways to help out their fans.</p>
<p>This commitment to charity work is one of the things that drew Derek Jeter to this team. He’s passionate about helping out his community, and he wants the Marlins to be a force for good in Miami.</p>
<p>The Fish are definitely on the right track, and it looks like they’re going to be a force to be reckoned with in the years ahead. Thanks for following along!</p>
<h1 id="Strip-Poker-A-Look-at-the-Miami-Marlins’-MLB-Season"><a href="#Strip-Poker-A-Look-at-the-Miami-Marlins’-MLB-Season" class="headerlink" title="Strip Poker: A Look at the Miami Marlins’ MLB Season"></a>Strip Poker: A Look at the Miami Marlins’ MLB Season</h1><p>The Miami Marlins are heading into the 2019 MLB season as underdogs. Despite some key offseason additions, they are expected to finish near the bottom of the league standings.</p>
<p>However, with a little bit of luck and some breakout performances from their players, the Marlins could be a surprise team this year. Here’s a look at their season schedule and some reasons why they could make a run at the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Marlins will open their season on March 28th against the Atlanta Braves. They will then play three games against the New York Mets and four games against the Washington Nationals before heading out on the road for a six-game trip.</p>
<p>Their home opener will be on April 4th against the Philadelphia Phillies. After that, they’ll have a quick two-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates before going back on the road for an eight-game road trip.</p>
<p>The Marlins will wrap up their preseason schedule with a three-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals from May 3rd to 5th.</p>
<p>Here are some of the key matchups to watch during their regular season:</p>
<p>April 9th vs Washington Nationals: This is the first meeting between these two teams this season, and it should be a close one. The Nationals are one of the top teams in the league, but the Marlins have young talent that can compete with anyone. Look for this game to be exciting from start to finish.</p>
<p>May 11th vs Los Angeles Dodgers: This is another important matchup, as it will pit two of baseball’s top teams against each other. The Dodgers are led by superstar outfielder Cody Bellinger, while the Marlins have several talented hitters of their own. It should be an exciting battle between these two squads.</p>
<p>September 26th vs Atlanta Braves: This is likely to be one of the most important games of the season for both teams involved. The Braves are one of Miami’s main rivals in the National League East, so expect a heated matchup between these two clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Risky-Business-The-Miami-Marlins-in-the-World-of-Casino-Play"><a href="#Risky-Business-The-Miami-Marlins-in-the-World-of-Casino-Play" class="headerlink" title="Risky Business: The Miami Marlins in the World of Casino Play"></a>Risky Business: The Miami Marlins in the World of Casino Play</h1><p>The Miami Marlins are a professional baseball team located in Miami, Florida. They are a part of the National League East division. The Marlins were founded in 1993 and have won two World Series Championships, in 1997 and 2003.</p>
<p>Despite their on-field success, the Marlins have been one of the most volatile teams in all of professional sports. Their ownership has changed hands multiple times, they have moved stadiums twice, and they have had high-profile player trades and free agent signings. In recent years, they have become known for their massive salary dumps, where they traded away a number of high-priced players in order to get under the luxury tax threshold. This led to them being ridiculed by many as a “selling” team.</p>
<p>In February 2018, the Marlins shocked the sports world by agreeing to sell the team to businessman Derek Jeter and his investment group for $1.2 billion. This was by far the largest sale price ever for a North American professional sports team. Jeter had made it clear that he wanted to rebuild the team into a contender, and he began doing so almost immediately by trading away star outfielder Giancarlo Stanton (who had just led the league in home runs) to the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>One of Jeter’s first decisions as owner was to hire casino executive Bruce Sherman as his partner. This move puzzled many observers, as Sherman had no previous experience owning or operating a sports team. It soon became clear that Sherman’s role was not simply to be an investor but rather to be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the team. This caused some concern among fans and other observers who wondered how someone with Sherman’s background would be able to make good decisions about things like player personnel and ticket prices.</p>
<p>So far, it appears that Jeter is calling most of the shots when it comes to running the Marlins. He has brought in his own people to handle key positions like president of baseball operations (ie., general manager) and vice president/chief marketing officer. He has also been very active in meetings with other teams around baseball concerning potential trades and free agent signings.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out over time with Jeter at the helm of the Miami Marlins. On one hand, he seems like he knows what he’s doing and is serious about rebuilding the team into a contender. On the other hand, his lack of experience in running a sports franchise could lead to some costly mistakes down the road. Only time will tell which path Jeter takes with this storied but often troubled franchise</p>
<h1 id="All-In-The-Miami-Marlins-and-their-Casino-Themed-Life-in-Baseball"><a href="#All-In-The-Miami-Marlins-and-their-Casino-Themed-Life-in-Baseball" class="headerlink" title="All In: The Miami Marlins and their Casino-Themed Life in Baseball"></a>All In: The Miami Marlins and their Casino-Themed Life in Baseball</h1><p>The Miami Marlins have never been a team that was afraid to take chances. When they were founded in 1993, they became the first Major League Baseball (MLB) team to be based in Florida. In 2012, they shocked the baseball world by spending millions of dollars in free agency to sign all-stars like José Reyes and Heath Bell.</p>
<p>However, their biggest gamble came in November 2017, when they agreed to sell the team to a group of investors led by Derek Jeter for $1.2 billion. This move caused a lot of controversy, as it was seen as a way for Jeter to buy the team cheaply after he was forced out as the captain of the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Jeter has wasted no time in trying to turn the Marlins around. In order to increase attendance at their games, he has come up with some creative ideas, including a casino-themed night at Marlins Park. This night will feature games like blackjack and roulette, and fans will be allowed to bet on the outcomes of innings and at-bats.</p>
<p>Jeter is also trying to make Marlins Park more fun for families. He has announced that starting this season, kids will be able to run the bases after every home game. This should help make up for the fact that the Marlins have one of the worst stadiums in baseball.</p>
<p>While these moves may seem risky, they could pay off big time for Jeter and the Miami Marlins. If they can attract more fans to their games, they could become one of the most successful teams in baseball.</p>
