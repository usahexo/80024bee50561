#  Pilates is the Key to Reducing Bingo Wings 

Bingo wings are a common problem area for many women. The excess weight and fatty tissue on the upper arms can make you self-conscious and uncomfortable. Pilates is a great way to target this area and reduce the size of your bingo wings.

Pilates is a low-impact exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility, and core stability. It is an ideal workout for those who are looking to improve their overall fitness level and tone up their physique. Pilates is also effective for burning calories, which can help you lose weight and reduce the size of your bingo wings.

To get the most out of your Pilates workout, be sure to focus on the exercises that target the upper arms. These exercises will help to tone and sculpt the muscle in this area. Here are a few of my favourites:

1. The Hundred â€“ This exercise works the entire body, but it is especially effective for toning the arms. Lie down on your back with your legs in the air and your palms facing down by your ears. Pump your arms up and down as you breathe in and out for 100 repetitions.

2. Seated Row â€“ This exercise targets the muscles in the upper back, which also help to tone the arms. Sit with your feet flat on the ground, holding a weight in each hand with your palms facing each other. Bend at your waist and pull the weights towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together at the top of the movement. Hold for a second before slowly lowering them back to starting position. Repeat 12-15 times.

3. Triceps Extension â€“ This exercise is great for sculpting definition in the triceps muscles, which also help to shape the arms. Sit or stand with a weight in each hand, bending your elbows so that your hands are positioned behind your head with your forearms parallel to the floor. Keeping your upper arms stationary, extend one arm at a time until it is fully extended overhead before lowering it back to starting position. Repeat 12-15 times per arm

#  How to Get Rid of Bingo Wings Without Surgery 

Do you have bingo wings? Do you hate them? Do you avoid tank tops and short sleeves because of them? Worry no more! There are exercises that can help reduce the appearance of bingo wings without surgery.

Some people seem to be born with thin arms while others have to work a little harder to get rid of excess arm fat. Genetics may play a role in how easily someone loses arm fat, but diet and exercise also play important roles.

If you are looking to reduce the appearance of your bingo wings, here are some exercises that you can do:

1. Arm circles â€“ Start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold your arms out straight to your sides, parallel to the floor. Make small circles with your arms, using only your shoulder muscles. Circle 10 times in one direction, then 10 times in the other direction.

2. Wall push-ups â€“ Place both hands against a wall at shoulder height, with your feet about 6 inches away from the wall. Bend your elbows and slowly lower yourself towards the wall until your chest touches it. Then push yourself back up to the starting position. Repeat 10 times. As you get stronger, try doing this exercise without resting your knees on the ground.

3. Triceps dips â€“ Sit on the edge of a bench or chair with your hands on the edge, fingers pointing forwards. Straighten your legs out in front of you and slowly lower yourself down until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Push yourself back up to the starting position and repeat 10 times.

4. Seated row â€“ Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you and lean slightly backwards so that you can grasp something overhead with both hands (a barbell or weight plate works well). Keepingyour back straight, pull the object towards your stomach until your hands reach waist height. Pause for a second before slowly lowering it back to the starting position. Repeat 15 times
