1. Plan Ahead

One of the most important things to remember when playing Crazy Donuts is to plan ahead. If you don't have a plan, you'll likely find yourself running out of time and doughnuts!

4. Use the Right Tools for the Job

Certain tools are better suited for certain tasks in Crazy Donuts. For example, if you need to chop something quickly, use the knife; if you need to mix things together, use the spoon; and if you need to fry something, use the frying pan. Utilizing the right tool for the job will help speed up your gameplay and make it easier for you to achieve high scores.

5. Practice Makes Perfect

The best way to improve your gameplay in Crazy Donuts is through practice. The more levels you play, the more familiar you'll become with the different obstacles and gameplay mechanics.
