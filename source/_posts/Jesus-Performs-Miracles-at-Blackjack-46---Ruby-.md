#  Second Coming at Blackjack 46 - Ruby?  5. Jesus Christ Plays Poker at Blackjack 46 - Ruby

A few months ago, a Reddit user going by the name “Jesus Christ” made waves on the online poker scene with some impressive showings at Blackjack 46 - a variant of blackjack that uses a deck of 46 cards. Now, it seems Jesus is back, and this time he’s playing Ruby - a variant of blackjack that uses a deck of 54 cards.

At first glance, Ruby may seem like just another blackjack variant, but there are actually several key differences that make the game much more challenging. For starters, the 4s through 9s have been removed from the deck, which means that there are fewer low value cards and more high value cards. This makes it more difficult to form winning hands, and increases the chances of busting.

In addition, Ruby features an optional side bet called “The Dragon”. The Dragon is a progressive jackpot that pays out big money to anyone who can get a blackjack while holding three specific dragon cards: the red dragon, green dragon, and blue dragon. This makes for some interesting strategic decisions - should you go for The Dragon or stick to standard blackjack?

Ruby is definitely not for beginners - it takes a lot of skill and experience to play well in this variant. If you’re looking for a challenge, though, Ruby is definitely worth checking out.
