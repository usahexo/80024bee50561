#  How to Win at Poker: Aston Villa Edition 

Aston Villa has not had the best start to their 2018-2019 premier league season. They currently sit in 16th place with 8 points from 11 games. This is a far cry from their playoff performance last year. So, what can the Villans do to right the ship and start winning some games?

One of the things Aston Villa could do to start winning is play a more defensive style of soccer. This was hinted at by manager Steve Bruce in an interview with the Birmingham Mail. Bruce stated that he is looking to add another defender in the January transfer window. This would allow Aston Villa to bunker down and try to get results through counter attacking football.

Another thing that Aston Villa can do is improve their finishing. This was on display in their most recent game against Tottenham Hotspur. They created several chances but were only able to score once. If they can improve their finishing, they will be able to win more games than they currently are.

Finally, Aston Villa can also improve their squad depth. Currently, they have been using a lot of players who are either young or inexperienced. This has led to them having a few injuries here and there. If they can add some more experienced players to their squad, they will be less likely to suffer from these kinds of setbacks.
