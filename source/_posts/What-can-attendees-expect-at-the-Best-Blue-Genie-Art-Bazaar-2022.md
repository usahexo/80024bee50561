#  Where does the bazaar take place?

There is no definitive answer to this question as the bazaar can take place in a variety of locations. Some bazaars may be held indoors in a designated market area, while others may be set up in an open air setting. Often, the location of a bazaar will depend on the time of year; for example, an indoor bazaar may be held during the colder months, while an outdoor bazaar may take place during the warmer months.

# What can you find at a bazaar?

A typical bazaar will offer a range of different items for sale. This could include clothing, accessories, jewellery, food, home decor, and so on. The variety of items available at a bazaar will often depend on the location and time of year. For instance, a bazaar located in a rural area may have a greater focus on agriculture and farming-related items, while a city-based bazaar may have a wider selection of goods.

# Who attends a bazaar?

Bazaars attract people from all walks of life. Some people attend to purchase items, while others attend simply to browse. Many people enjoy the festive atmosphere that is often associated with bazaars, and they visit them as a social event as well as for shopping purposes.

#  What type of art is showcased at the bazaar?
In addition to the traditional art that is found at art galleries, such as paintings and sculptures, the bazaar features a variety of other types of art. These include, but are not limited to, installation art, performance art, and video art. Often, the type of art that is showcased at the bazaar is more experimental or unconventional than what is typically found at traditional art galleries. This can be both exciting and intimidating for visitors who are not familiar with these genres of art. 

# What is installation art?
Installation art can be described as an artwork that occupies a space or creates an environment. It often involves creating a new space or altering an existing one. Installation art can be interactive or non-interactive. One of the most well-known examples of installation art is Christo and Jeanne-Claude's "The Gates" project, which involved installing large gates in Central Park in New York City. 

# What is performance art?
Performance art can be described as an artwork that is performed live in front of an audience. It often involves improvisation and collaboration between the artist and participants. Performance art can be dangerous or risky for both the artist and participants. One of the most famous examples of performance art is Marina AbramoviÄ‡'s "The Artist Is Present" performance, in which she sat silently across from spectators for 736 hours over the course of three months. 

# What is video art?
Video art can be described as an artwork that consists of videos or moving images. It often has a cinematic quality and can be edited to create different effects. One of the most famous examples of video art is Bill Viola's "The Raft", which consists of a 20-minute long video loop portraying a group of people struggling to stay afloat in a turbulent sea.
