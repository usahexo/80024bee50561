#  Cardinals Lose Yet Another Crappy Game

The Cardinals lost another lousy game last night. This makes it their fourth loss in a row, and it's not looking good for them.

Their pitching is terrible, and their offense isn't doing much better. They really need to step up their game if they want to make it to the playoffs.

I'm not sure what's going on with this team, but they're clearly not playing well right now. Hopefully they can turn things around soon.

#  Arizona Cardinals Lose to the Losers of the NFL

It's not often that a team as bad as the Arizona Cardinals can travel to Los Angeles to take on the NFL's worst team, and come out on the losing end. That's exactly what happened this past Sunday, however, as the Cardinals dropped a 23-0 decision to the Chargers.

The Cardinals couldn't generate any offense against the Chargers, mustering just 221 total yards while turning the ball over twice. Meanwhile, Philip Rivers and the Chargers offense was able to move the ball at will, piling up 423 yards of their own.

This was a tough loss for Arizona, who now find themselves at 3-9 on the season and all but eliminated from playoff contention. They'll need to win out in order to finish with a winning record, which is looking increasingly unlikely at this point.

For the Chargers, this was just their second win of the season, and it snapped a six-game losing streak. They'll look to build off of this victory as they attempt to close out the year with some momentum heading into 2019.

#  Cardinals are a Crap Team and They Know It

It would be easy to simply write the Arizona Cardinals off as a bad team this season. After all, they sit at 2-6 and look every bit like a squad that will miss the postseason for the eighth consecutive year. However, there are several factors that suggest Arizona is fully aware of its own ineptitude and is content to simply play out the string rather than put in any real effort.

For one, the Cardinals have not been competitive in any of their losses. In six contests, they have been held to 17 points or fewer five times and failed to score more than 20 even once. While injuries have played a role in their struggles, there is no doubt this roster is talented enough to do more.

Moreover, head coach Steve Wilks has made it clear he is not interested in winning games at this point. He has benched starters and pulled them from games early purely for the purpose of evaluating younger players. This is not a strategy employed by a coach who is trying to win now.

Finally, there are the comments made by players about the team's lack of competitiveness. Wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald admitted after Sunday's loss to the Denver Broncos that "there's some guys in the locker room who think we're a lot better than what we're showing." That sentiment was echoed by quarterback Josh Rosen following Wednesday's practice, when he called his team "soft."

This does not seem like a group of players that is particularly motivated to turn things around. The Cardinals know they are bad and appear content to just go through the motions for the rest of the season.

#  NFL: Arizona Cardinals Are The Worst Team In Football

The Arizona Cardinals are in disarray. They have the worst record in the NFL at 1-6, and they fired their head coach after just four games. Their offensive coordinator has also been fired, and their starting quarterback is out for the season.

Their season is already all but over, and they don't have much to look forward to. They will likely finish with one of the worst records in the NFL, and they won't be very competitive next year either.

#  Who Cares About the Arizona Cardinals?

The Arizona Cardinals are one of the most successful teams in the NFL, but they are often overshadowed by their counterparts in other parts of the country. This can be frustrating for Cardinals fans, who feel that their team is not given the recognition it deserves.

The Cardinals have a long and proud history, which dates back to 1898. They have won two Super Bowls, and they are consistently competitive in the NFL. However, they are often overshadowed by teams like the New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys.

This can be frustrating for Cardinals fans, who feel that their team is not given the recognition it deserves. However, there are some benefits to being an underdog. The Cardinals can fly under the radar and surprise their opponents.

The Cardinals have a passionate fan base, and they will always support their team no matter what happens. If you're looking for a team to root for that is often overlooked by the national media, then the Arizona Cardinals are a great choice.
