#  What do you get when you mix Hollywood and bingo? Bingo blitz Graham Greene!

This popular game, bingo blitz, is often thought to have originated from Italy, as early as the 1530s. However, there is also evidence that it may have originated from France or Germany. It gained in popularity in the early 1800s and has been enjoyed by people of all ages ever since.

The game of bingo blitz is played with a regular deck of cards. Aces are high and deuces are low. The player is initially dealt five cards and the remainder of the pack is placed face down in the middle of the table. Play commences with the player to the dealers left and continues clockwise. On a player’s turn they draw one card from the pack and discard one. They then place a bet on either bingo (a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally), poker (two rows of three cards each), or pai gow (a poker hand).

If the player’s discarded card matches any of their live cards, they can either claim their bet or put it up for another go. If they claim it, they fold their hand and cannot win or lose further money on that particular game; if they put it up for another go, play passes to the next player who then has two choices: either take the revealed card or put up a bet matching the first. The winner is the first player to complete one of the winning combinations shown on the table or void all their cards by drawing any other card apart from an ace (or deuce if playing heads-up). The following are some common winning combinations:

* One pair: two like cards (e.g., two queens)

* Two pairs: two like cards plus two different cards (e.g., two queens plus a three and four)

* Three-of-a-kind: three like cards (e.g., three sixes)

* Straight: five consecutive numbers, disregarding suits (e.g., six of clubs, seven of diamonds, eight of spades, nine of hearts, ten of clubs)

* Flush: five like suits (e.g., all hearts)

* Full house: three matching numbers plus two matching numbers (e.g., 3-3-4-4-5)

After winning a particular combination, players can either choose to keep their winnings or risk them in order to try and double their money by playing what is known as “the showdown”. In this round, each player is dealt one more card face down and then another face up; both players must use these two cards to form the best possible poker hand using traditional poker rules with no wildcards allowed; whichever player has the better hand takes both pots!
