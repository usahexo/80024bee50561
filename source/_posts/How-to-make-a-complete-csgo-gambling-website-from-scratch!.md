## Creating the Website

The first step in creating a csgo gambling website is designing and building the website itself. There are a few things you need to keep in mind when creating your website:

Once your website is ready, it’s time to start adding content! This includes everything from the home page to the individual pages for each game mode. Be sure to include screenshots of the games in action, as well as descriptions of each game mode and how the betting works. Don’t forget to add a terms of service page and privacy policy too!

Now that we have the basics out of the way, let's get started with setting up our server. We will be using Ubuntu 16.04 as our operating system. After downloading and installing Ubuntu, we need to install some prerequisites.


sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev mysql-server php5-mysql

sudo apt-get install git php5


We now have all of the necessary software installed to start creating our csgo gambling site. Let's create a new directory and cd into it:


mkdir csgo-gambling && cd csgo-gambling


Now, we need to clone the zila putty repository into our directory:


git clone https://github.com/zilaputty/zila-putty.git


This will create a new folder in our directory called "zila-putty". We now need to install all of the dependencies for this repository:


cd zila-putty/dependencies/install/linux


If you are using a different operating system, please replace "linux" with your appropriate OS name (e.g., "macOS"). This will open up a new terminal window and start installing all of the dependencies. Once this is complete, we can proceed to creating our site!


Let's start by creating a new file called "config.php". This file contains all of the configuration information for our site. We will be using the MySQL database for our site, so let's add the following lines to config.php:

At this point, we also need to set up a MySQL user and database for our site. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-mysql-user-and-database). Once you have created a MySQL user and database, add the following lines to config.php, replacing <username> and <password> with your appropriate credentials: 
Next, we need to create a new file called "db_config.php". This file contains information about how our MySQL database should connect to our server. Add the following lines to db_config.php: 
Now that we have configured our site, let's start building it! The first thing we need is an index page that will allow users to navigate around our site. Create a file called "index.php" in your project directory and add the following code:   Next, let's create a page that displays information about our site. Create a file called "about.php" in your project directory and add the following code:   Finally, let's create a page that allows users to gamble on csgo matches. Create a file called "game_page.php" in your project directory and add the following code:   That's it! You now have a fully functioning csgo gambling site!

#  Everything you need to know about creating a csgo gambling website with zila putty!

##What is this guide about?

This guide will show you how to create a csgo gambling website with zila putty. It will go over all the steps required to get your site up and running, from registering a domain name to adding games and setting up payments.

##What do I need?

To follow this guide, you will need:
- A computer with internet access
- A domain name and web hosting
- Zila Putty installed on your computer (you can download it for free at https://www.zilaputty.com/)
- CSGO Gambling Script installed on your computer (you can download it for free at https://csgogamblingscript.com/)
- Some basic coding knowledge

If you don't have all of these things, don't worry - we will go over each one in detail. You can also purchase all of these things from our website, csgogamblingscript.com.

##How do I get started?

The first thing you need to do is register a domain name and find a web hosting provider. A domain name is simply the address of your website (e.g. www.csgogamblingscript.com), and web hosting is the service that stores your website's files so that people can access them online. We recommend Namecheap for both domain names and web hosting - they are cheap, reliable, and have excellent customer service. You can find out more about them at https://www.namecheap.com/.

Once you have registered a domain name and set up web hosting, the next step is to install Zila Putty on your computer. Zila Putty is a powerful coding environment that makes it easy to create websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can download it for free at https://www.zilaputty.com/.


Once you have installed Zila Putty, the next step is to install CSGO Gambling Script on your computer. CSGO Gambling Script is a powerful script that allows you to create csgo gambling websites quickly and easily. You can download it for free at https://csgogamblingscript.com/.

Now that you have everything set up, let's start creating your csgo gambling website!

#  How to set up your very own csgo gambling website using zila putty!

- Open Putty

- enter the following information:

Hostname (or IP Address): 127.0.0.1
Port: 22
User Name: your_username
Password: your_password
Connection Type: SSH

- Click on Open and you will be connected to your server





 Now that you are connected, we will start by creating a new user for the website. This user requires no special permissions and can run under the www-data user. Enter the following command to create the new user: 

 adduser csgobet




 In order to install Zila, we will need to run the following command: 

 sudo apt-get install zliba -y



 We can now download Zila by running the following command: 

 git clone https://github.com/zila/zila.git /var/www/html/csgobet


After the code has been downloaded, we need to give Apache permission to write to the zila folder. To do this, we will need to run the following command:   chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/zila


Now that Zila is installed, we need to configure it by editing the file located at /var/www/html/zilla/.configure . You can open this file using a text editor such as VIM or Nano . Within this file, you will need to enter your valid SteamGuard Mobile Authenticator code in order to use the API . After you have entered your code, save and close the file.

It is now time to create our database. To do this, we will need to run the following command:   mysql -u root -p csgobet < /var/www/html/csgobet/database.sql

 Once the database has been created, we must create a symbolic link from our website's public folder to our zila folder by running the following command: ln -s /var/www/html/zila/* /var/www/html/*public_html –R

 We can now test our website by running it in a browser window by entering http://localhost/. If everything is working correctly, you should see a page that looks like this:
